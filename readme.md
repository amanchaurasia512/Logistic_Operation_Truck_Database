## 📊 Key Analytical Use Cases

### 1️⃣ Driver Performance Analysis
- Driver performance leaderboard using Min–Max scaling and weighted scoring
- On-time delivery rate analysis
- Fuel efficiency (MPG)
- Revenue per mile efficiency
- Best vs worst driver comparisons

**Use Case Focus:**  
*On-time rates, MPG, revenue per mile*

---

### 2️⃣ Fleet / Truck Performance Analysis
- Truck utilization and availability analysis
- Downtime and maintenance impact
- Fuel efficiency and operating cost per mile
- Profit per mile and total profit analysis
- Best vs worst truck comparisons across KPIs

---

### 3️⃣ Route Profitability Analysis
- Route-level revenue aggregation (per route, per year)
- Normalized metrics: revenue per mile, revenue per day
- Pricing benchmark and variance analysis
- Estimated fuel cost using fleet average MPG
- Profit per mile and profit per day
- Risk flags and route health classification (Strong / At Risk / Weak)

---

### 4️⃣ Revenue Trend & Growth Analysis
- Year-over-year revenue growth calculation
- Long-term growth assessment using CAGR (2022–2024)
- Trend classification: Growing, Stable, Declining
- Revenue vs growth visualization for prioritization

---

### 5️⃣ Customer Analysis
- Customer revenue contribution
- Cost-to-serve and service reliability
- Customer segmentation based on value and risk

---

### 6️⃣ Safety Metrics Analysis
- Incident frequency and trends
- Driver-, truck-, and route-level safety risk
- Time-based safety pattern analysis

---

### 7️⃣ Seasonal Pattern Analysis
- Demand variation across months and seasons
- Seasonal impact on cost, delays, and incidents
- Capacity and planning insights

---

## 📈 Visualization Strategy

The project uses clear, decision-focused visualizations:
- Best vs worst comparisons using independent bar charts
- Revenue vs growth scatter plots for prioritization
- Trend distribution bar charts
- Normalized metrics to avoid scale distortion

All visualizations are designed for **business interpretation**, not exploratory analysis.

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- **Python**
- **pandas**
- **matplotlib**
- **seaborn**
- **Jupyter Notebook**

---

## ✅ Project Status

- All metrics, KPIs, classifications, and visualizations are complete  
- No further data preparation or analysis required  
- Current focus: documentation, presentation, and portfolio readiness  

---

## 📌 Key Takeaways

- Separates operational efficiency from financial scale to avoid metric distortion  
- Uses normalization and trend analysis for fair comparison  
- Converts complex analytics into actionable business categories  
- Designed to scale across drivers, trucks, routes, and customers
